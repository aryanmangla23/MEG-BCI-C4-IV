# MEG-BCI-CIV-D3

This project taught me how to process and decode MEG signals to classify hand movement direction using spatial and spectral features. By working with real BCI Competition IV data (Subject S1), I developed practical skills in signal preprocessing, artifact removal, feature extraction, and machine learning evaluation.

* Signal filtering (Butterworth), ICA with scikit-learn
* Spatial feature extraction with CSP
* Time-frequency analysis using pywt
* Classifier training & evaluation (SVM, cross-validation)
* Data visualization (ERP, topomaps, time-frequency plots)
